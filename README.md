### Project Summary:
We created a shiny app to do sentiment classification (Positive / Negative) on IMDB movie review dataset. Classification is done through a neural network model (trained with 8 special features engineered from movie reviews) that performs with an AUC of 91% (10 pts improvement vs. base model).

For more detail, please refer to the [report](https://github.com/ekapopev/IMDb_Sentiment_Analysis/blob/master/Project%20Report.pdf).


Apart from the classification task the shiny app also provides visualizations that generate insights into the test reviews data.

You can try by uploading your own dataset directly in ShinyApp. Sample csv input can be found [here](https://github.com/ekapopev/IMDb_Sentiment_Analysis/blob/master/IMDb_Sentiment_Analysis/Data/test.csv).
The ShinyApp is published via this [link](https://ekapopev.shinyapps.io/IMDb_Sentiment_Analysis/).
